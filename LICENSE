Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2024 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share the software and to change it. By doing this, you can help others.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions are embodied in the GNU General Public License. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes with others, and that you know you can do these things.

Finally, any program is free software if users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve it. Specifically, freedom means that the program must be available in source code form, and that users are allowed to change it. 

Therefore, the criteria for freedom are:
1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour (freedom 2).
4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
